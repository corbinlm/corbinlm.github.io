Using administrative tax data, we plot the population distribution of premiums and provide new evidence about the relationship between premiums and demographic characteristics, such as income. First, we demonstrate that the distribution of premiums measured in the tax data is comparable to survey data. Then we leverage detailed individual-level information for the population of tax filers to show that those with higher incomes are more likely to have an employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) policy and, conditional on having a policy, select more expensive plans. In fact, those in the top 10 percent of the income distribution account for 21 percent of aggregate ESI premiums. Even with these disparities though, inequality in ESI spending is less than half of that in income overall.\n","date":1565467482,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565467482,"objectID":"fe7a270a693b9f1d044bff6836941ded","permalink":"https://corbinmiller.website/publication/premiums/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T16:04:42-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/premiums/","section":"publication","summary":"We explore how teachers unions affect education production by comparing outcomes between districts allocating new tax revenue amidst collective bargaining negotiations and districts allocating tax revenue well before.

Specifically, we estimate the effect of cigarette taxes during early childhood on beginning smoking later in adolescence in a discrete-time hazard model. These taxes do not directly affect children but may change the prevalence of smoking among parents, older relatives, or other adults. We find that a $0.25 cigarette tax increase during childhood decreases smoking initiation by 12.5 percent. Our results suggest that parents and older siblings do not account for the entire indirect effect, so other members of the community also likely play a role.

Property values also affect school spending through both local property tax revenue and the level of state aid provided to each school district. However, little is known about the effect property values have on student achievement through their impact on school revenue. In this paper, I estimate the effect of education spending on district-level student outcomes in 24 states by leveraging changes in revenue driven by property value variation. I interact state-level changes in property values with fixed school finance formulas that measure how state aid and local revenue respond to those changes (the \u0026ldquo;wealth price\u0026rdquo;) to create a simulated instrument for school spending. By collecting administrative data on property values for over 7,000 school districts, I am able to measure a leave-one-out mean change in property values for school districts in each state. The instrument is highly predictive of changes in revenue and spending. My estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in spending improves graduation rates by 3 to 5 percentage points and student test scores by 0.07 to 0.09 standard deviations. These results suggest that market variation in property values affects student outcomes through existing school finance formulas.\n","date":1565465096,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565465096,"objectID":"4b9759f9ef2cb4a8e2f2566a61a80a51","permalink":"https://corbinmiller.website/paper/jmp/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T15:24:56-04:00","relpermalink":"/paper/jmp/","section":"paper","summary":"Opportunities to estimate the causal effect of school spending on student achievement are infrequent and have been based, almost entirely, on variation in spending from large school finance reforms.
